**Introduction**

In this open source project, I attempted to identify the modulation types of RF I/Q signal samples created by Tim O'shea, a researcher at Virginia Tech. The motivation of the project was funded by DARPA to identify emitters at various signal to noise ratios. However, at low ratios, it becomes very difficult for individuals to identify signal's modulation type by eye. So the intent was to apply Neural Networks to automate this process.
